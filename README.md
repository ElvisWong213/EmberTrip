# Ember Trip View

## About this project
The goal of this project is to create a mobile view that provides useful information about individual bus trips to potential passengers. The new view will include scheduled and estimated times at stops, a live map showing the busâ€™s current position, and potentially additional features like notifications. The aim is to enhance the passenger experience and provide all the necessary information to make informed decisions about their journey.

## Requirement 
- Swift 5+
- Xcode 15.1+

## Need To Improve 
1. Map Camera
   - Adjust camera position when user resize the sheet view.
2. Arrival Notification
   - Create an animation to demonstrate the feature.
   - Or change the swip gesture to a button.
3. Bus Stops List View
   - Simplify the user interface to ensure it is not overwhelming.
4. Unit test in NotificationService
